# Big Mart Sales Prediction
This project aims to predict the sales of various products in Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about different products and their attributes, as well as outlet-specific details such as size, location, and type.

# Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and prepared the dataset for modeling.
Model Training: Utilized the XGBoost regressor algorithm to train a predictive model on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using the R-squared metric on both training and testing datasets.
Files Included
Train.csv: Dataset containing training data.
Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for deployment.
requirements.txt: File listing the Python packages required to run the code.
